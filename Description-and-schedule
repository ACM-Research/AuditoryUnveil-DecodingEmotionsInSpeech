Title 
Auditory Unveil: Decoding emotions in speech via deep learning
Description
The emotion behind human speech plays a significant role in almost every activity we perform in our daily lives. From communication to interpretation, emotion plays a key role in every response we give. Wouldn’t it be interesting if a machine could recognize the exact emotion in an audio clip?
Speech Emotion Detection or SER plays an integral part in advancing Human Computer Interactions. In this project, you will learn how to analyze audio frequencies and patterns using librosa. You will also make a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) learning model that will teach the system to recognize the various emotions. Our goal is to make a model that can accurately predict the emotion behind speech.
